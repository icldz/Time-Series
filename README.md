**Introduction**

Forecasting based on time series data plays a significant role in decision-making processes and economic analysis. ARIMA is one of the most impactful and emerging techniques for predicting time series data. Throughout this guide, you’ll learn all you need about ARIMA modelling.

**Understanding Time Series**

**Time series** data is a set of data points captured at equal intervals: daily, monthly, or even year. This kind of data is used in many disciplines, such as economics, finance, environmental science, or social science since it facilitates the investigation of the behavior of processes and phenomena over time. 

**Time Series** forecasting uses statistical models to estimate future values of a time series from its past data. Forecasting a time series is often of tremendous commercial value.

**Forecasting a time series can be divided into two categories**,
1.	Univariate time series forecasting 
Univariate time series forecasting is the process of forecasting the future values of a single variable using its past data and for instance, forecasting future stock prices from past stock prices. 
2.	Multivariate time series forecasting
Multivariate time series forecasting is the process of predicting future values based on multiple interconnected time-dependent variables.  This method captures the complex relationships and interdependencies among various factors, leading to more accurate predictions. For example, business organizations could examine several economic factors, consumer spending, and seasons to aid in predicting sales.

**Time Series Components**
Studying time series components is significant before modelling as they interpret patterns and trends in time-dependent data. The various uses each component showcases come in as an advantage since every one of them takes a different way of looking at the behavior of the data over time, hence enabling one to analyze, calculate, forecast, and make decisions based on references to past trends and fluctuations of the data. Four main time series components can be identified as,

1.	**Trend Component**
The trend component of the time series data shows the long-term direction, whether it’s increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable over time.
